						The UK has pledged to reach Net-Zero carbon emissions by 2050. Actuation Lab are fully on board with 
						the programme and pledge to do our bit to achieve that goal as we scale.  We are pleased to announce 
						that we have just been awarded an SBRI Sustainable Innovation Fund project, funded by Innovate UK. 
						This project is supported by Bristol Water and the Oil and Gas Technology Centre. This project will see 
						our team assess how we can utilise our technology to reduce greenhouse gas leaks (fugitive emissions) on gas 
						distribution networks and reduce energy used in pumping in the utilities sector. <br> <br> Innovate UK, as part 
						of UK Research and Innovation, is investing up to £191 million to fund single and collaborative research 
						and development projects as part of the Sustainable Innovation Fund over the next two years. The aim of 
						these competitions is to help all sectors of the UK rebuild after the effects of COVID-19. <br> <br>The Sustainable 
						Innovation Fund is funding 1,103 projects, 1069 UK businesses and totalling over £130 million in support 
						across the UK. <br><br> Innovate UK Executive Chair Dr Ian Campbell said: <br><br> “In these difficult times we have seen the 
						best of British business innovation. The pandemic is not just a health emergency but one that impacts society 
						and the economy.<br><br> Actuation Lab’s project developing net-zero flow control solutions, along with every initiative 
						Innovate UK has supported through this fund, is an important step forward in driving sustainable economic development.
						Each one is also helping to realise the ambitions of hard-working people.” </a>
