		<h4>	Hydraulic pistons are a centuries-old technology that are used to make the world’s machines move. Despite their use across all industries, 
		they are far from optimised for use in extreme environments. Their steel structures corrode in saltwater conditions and the complex arrangement of sliding seals 
		lead to failure as surfaces degrade. This is a billion-pound problem in the Oil and Gas, marine and mining Industries.
		
			<p>Actuation Lab has invented a technology that will replace these failing pistons. Our technology is designed to survive in the world’s dirtiest, dustiest and most 
			corrosive environments indefinitely.
			<p>Using a ground-up design approach, we have invented an entirely new way of creating movement, using conventional hydraulic supply systems. Drawing on our team’s 
			experience in the development of advanced aerospace composite materials, we have created a technology that is corrosion-proof and 1/3 of the weight of the equivalent 
			hydraulic piston. Our actuators have no sliding seals and thus, we have removed the feature that leads to 90% of piston failures.
			<p>Actuation Lab is currently supported by InnovateUK’s ICURe programme and based in SETsquared Bristol.
