		<h3 class="mobile">	Actuation Lab was founded in Bristol, UK, by Michael, Simon and Tom in 2018. 
			After completing their PhD’s in composite materials together at the University 
			of Bristol in 2017, the three friends began discussing a new collaboration that 
			could build on past work with composite artificial muscles, functional 3D printed 
			energy absorbing structures and novel strategies for print file generation. 
			They soon arrived at the Actuation Lab concept, Harnessing the Potential of Complex 
			Structures to Create Powerful Artificial Muscles.
			<p>The cost of engineering complex structures has dropped rapidly with the maturing of digital design and manufacturing, 
			particularly with regards to 3D printing. What this means is that where the mechanical 
			functionality of a device, like an actuator, would traditionally be achieved by an 
			assembly of different parts and materials, we can now economically replicate this 
			functionality using structure alone. What this means is devices with simplified 
			manufacture and improved reliability. It means replacing expensive materials with 
			low-cost materials, structured in intelligent ways. It means unprecedented power-to-weight 
			output can be achieved through facilitating the most efficient distribution of materials 
			for the desired functionality. 
			<p>In 2018 we were runner-up in the university of Bristol new 
			enterprise competition, and in 2019 began working from the SetSquared business incubator 
			at Brunel’s Bristol engine Shed.
